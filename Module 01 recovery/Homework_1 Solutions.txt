1.a pwd shows the current working directory as /home/user/Module 01


1.b ls is a linux shell command that list directory contents of files and directories and an addition of -l will give you a list with long format and show permissions of the files.


1.c -al/-la  will show a list long format that will include hidden files


1.d the permission for this directory is read, write, and execute

1.e && is "and". What it means is it change current directory to the new test directory "and" give a list with long format + show permission of the files
    total 0 shows us that there is a total of 0 files inside the new directory

1.f cd .. command moves the directory back by one directory, also known as the parent directory while cd command takes you back to the root/home directory 

1.g

function cd() {
new_directory="$*";
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
new_directory=${HOME};
fi;
builtin cd "${new_directory}" 
}

when cd is used, it will go to the root directory and will list the files/directory that is contained in the root directory. In this case, Module 01.

1.h The backslash (\) character is used to mark special characters so that they are not interpreted by the shell, but passed on to the command being run

1.i "this is my first file" pops out. it read and echo the line onto the terminal

1.j it has two ">>" character compared to the first line that has only one ">" character.

1.k the output is the whole second line "this is the second line" with the word second highlighted.

1.l the file has not been removed. We can verify that the directory haven't been removed by typing "ls" in the terminal. 

1.m The command does not work because rmdir only remove empty directory

1.n The primary differences between rm and rmdir is that rm removes files and directories while rmdir only removes directories. Option -rf means force recursively remove directories and contents

2.a read and write permission for the owner, read for group and others
	-rw-r--r--

2.b changes the permission for group to others. 
	-rw-------

2.c ls: cannot access 'questions': No such file or directory

4.a listing all the file inside home directory
       Module 01
	
4.b cp copy the data inside old, and paste into a new file called new

4.i  jump back to the home directory.

4.j “rm” removes directory, -r means recursively named myfolder
