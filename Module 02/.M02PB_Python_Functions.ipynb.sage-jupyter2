It takes two lines of code to print a list using a for loop, so these two lines are repeated whenever you want to print out the contents of a list. This is the perfect opportunity to use a function, so let's see how the code looks with a function.\n\nFirst, let's see the code we had without a function:","cell_type":"markdown"}
{"type":"cell","id":"058fd2","pos":21,"input":"This is much cleaner code. We have an action we want to take, which is to show the students in our list along with a message. We give this action a name, *show\\_students()*. \n\nThis function needs two pieces of information to do its work, the list of students and a message to display. Inside the function, the code for printing the message and looping through the list is exactly as it was in the non-function code.\n\nNow the rest of our program is cleaner, because it gets to focus on the things we are changing in the list, rather than having code for printing the list. We define the list, then we sort it and call our function to print the list. We sort it again, and then call the printing function a second time, with a different message. This is much more readable code.\n\n### Advantages of using functions\nYou might be able to see some advantages of using functions, through this example:\n\n- We write a set of instructions once. We save some work in this simple example, and we save even more work in larger programs.\n- When our function works, we don't have to worry about that code anymore. Every time you repeat code in your program, you introduce an opportunity to make a mistake. Writing a function means there is one place to fix mistakes, and when those bugs are fixed, we can be confident that this function will continue to work correctly.\n- We can modify our function's behavior, and that change takes effect every time the function is called. This is much better than deciding we need some new behavior, and then having to change code in many different places in our program.","cell_type":"markdown"}
